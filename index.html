                    George Denis Patrick Carlin (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American stand-up comedian, actor,
                    author,
                    and social critic. Regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comedians of all
                    time,
                    he was dubbed "the dean of counterculture comedians". He was known for his black comedy and
                    reflections on
                    politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and taboo subjects. His "seven dirty words"
                    routine
                    was central to the 1978 United States Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, in which a
                    5–4
                    decision affirmed the government's power to censor indecent material on the public airwaves.

                <p>
                    The first of Carlin's 14 stand-up comedy specials for HBO was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s
                    onwards,
                    his routines focused on sociocultural criticism of American society. He often commented on American
                    political
                    issues and satirized American culture. He was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight
                    Show during
                    the three-decade Johnny Carson era and hosted the first episode of Saturday Night Live in 1975.
                    His final comedy special, It's Bad for Ya, was filmed less than four months before his death from cardiac failure. 
                    In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.
